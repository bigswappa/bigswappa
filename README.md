# Jennifer Dhavle

👩‍💻 **Full Stack Developer** | 🧑‍🔬 **Caltech Alum** | 🌍 **Tech Enthusiast**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Jennifer, a passionate full-stack developer with a background in computational neuroscience from Caltech. I’m deeply interested in making the web a better place with elegant and efficient code. When I’m not coding, I’m probably experimenting with new tech or binge-watching science documentaries.  

## 🧑‍🎓 Education

- **B.S. in Computer Science and Neuroscience** - California Institute of Technology (Caltech)
- **M.S. in Quantum Computing** - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

## 💻 Skills & Technologies

- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C++, Rust, HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: React, Angular, Django, Flask, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- **Dev Tools**: Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins
- **Other**: Blockchain Development, Machine Learning, Quantum Algorithms

## 🔧 Projects

### 1. **NeuroLang**  
A natural language processing library designed to simulate neural network-based learning models. Built in Python, this project aims to bridge the gap between deep learning and neuroscience-inspired algorithms.

### 2. **QuantumChat**  
An encrypted, decentralized messaging platform using quantum cryptography principles. Inspired by my time at MIT, this project is still in early stages but shows a lot of promise for the future of secure communication.

### 3. **AI-Powered Fitness Tracker**  
An app that tracks and optimizes your workout based on AI predictions of your body’s needs. I built this project to combine my interests in health and machine learning. It integrates wearables and provides personalized feedback.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced Cryptography Techniques
- Building Full-Stack Web Applications with WebAssembly
- Machine Vision with TensorFlow
- Space Exploration Algorithms (because why not?)

## 📚 Publications

- "Harnessing AI for Predictive Medicine: A Case Study on Neurodegenerative Diseases" - *Journal of Computational Neuroscience*, 2024
- "The Future of Quantum Computing in Web Development" - *Tech Innovators Magazine*, 2023

## 🎮 Hobbies & Fun Stuff

- **Competitive Speed Solving**: I can solve a Rubik's Cube in under 30 seconds. Not to brag, but I hold the local record (or at least, I *did* until my cat chewed up the cube).
- **Astrophotography**: I spend clear nights capturing stunning images of the stars. My favorite subject is the Andromeda Galaxy. It’s *literally* light years away, but I still make it look good.
- **Sandcastle Engineering**: When I’m on the beach, I don’t just build sandcastles—I engineer them. I have designed fully functional (well, almost) sand structures, including a sand version of the Eiffel Tower that *may* have collapsed under high winds.
- **Quantum Pizza**: My hobbies are unpredictable, and so is my pizza. Using quantum tunneling (read: a fancy oven setting), I create pizzas that are always slightly different every time I bake them.
